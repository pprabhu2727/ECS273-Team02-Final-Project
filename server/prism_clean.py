PRISM Climate Data File Cleanup Script

This script processes PRISM climate data files to standardize their naming convention
and remove unnecessary files. PRISM data comes with complex filenames that include
metadata, but we need clean date-based names for our heatmap generation system.

The script keeps only the essential file types (.bil, .hdr, .prj) that are needed
for raster processing and renames them to a YYYY-MM-DD format that matches our
database date formatting.
